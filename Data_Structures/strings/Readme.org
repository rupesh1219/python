* Strings

** About the practice:
   From the Coding bat problems, the below are practiced well with basic python programming mainly used funcitons in most of the problems.

*** Below are the different type of problems solved in strings:

   1. Basic strings exoploration in python
   2. String Slicing
   3. Traversal thriugh strings
   4. looping through a string and counting
   5. String comparision

***   Miscillaneius things learnt during practing strings -

   1. functions in python
   2. emacs python mode execution
   3. console input
   4. exploration of search algorithms for search word problems.

***   Should explore:

   1. string methods
   2. more on search words problmes - search algorithms
   3. advanced way of solving the problems


** A string is a sequence:
   1. A string is a sequence of characters. Can be accessed using bracket operators.
      name = 'fruit'
      name[1] prints 'r'
   2. Characters in a string are accessed using index values as shown above.

** Strings are immutable:
   1. Characters in a string are fixed they cannot be replaced i.e., strings are immutable where as lists are mutable which we will practicing in the lists section.

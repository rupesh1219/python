'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
'''

'''
steps:

create two loops so that you can generate product
convert that product into string
check if reverse of a string is same as original
then find the max of the list generated
